"""
This script:

- Pulls out a list of file names from SQLite database
- The list of files to extract can be customised using SQL query (-s/--sql flag) or use default values
- The default query selects all files that haven't been backed up, aren't from CM and have a class_name of 'None'
- The program iterates over list of file names and searches for each file in specified directory
- When file is found, the file is converted to FLAC using ffmpeg and saved in specified directory
- Original wav file is deleted at the end
